## Summary

We try to apply Bayesian approach by employing numerical apporximations from Lindley (1980) and Tierney & Kadane (1986) on survival data which are considered interval-censored. We have considered only a parametric approach assuming the survival data follows a loglogistic distribution model.


### Loglogistic information

Cumulative distribution
$$ F(t, \alpha, \beta) = \Big[1 + (\frac{t}{\alpha})^{-\beta}\Big]^{-1} $$

Probability density function
$$ f(t, \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}(\frac{t}{\alpha})^{\beta-1}\Big[1 + (\frac{t}{\alpha})^{-\beta}\Big]^{-2} $$

### Bayesian estimation of the unknown parameters

Suppose we have some information on the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as priori. since both parameters of hte loglogistic model are positive and greater than zero, we assume $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have the following gamma prior distributions:

$$ \pi(\alpha) \propto \alpha^{\ a-1}exp(-\alpha\ b) $$
$$ \pi(\beta) \propto \beta^{\ c-1}exp(-\beta\ d) $$
