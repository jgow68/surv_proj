```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## summary

the first project focuses on the 

As for the second project, we will be looking at expanding the scope through the following: 
1. Estimation of the Bayesian parameters with asymmetric loss functions
2. Computational aspects of Bayesian parametric and non-parametric approach
3. Implementation on methods for interval-censored data in R with package Icens and intcox

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
