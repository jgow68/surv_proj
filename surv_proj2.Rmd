## summary

The first project focuses on employing numerical apporximations from Lindley (1980) and Tierney & Kadane (1986) on survival data which are considered interval-censored. We have considered only a parametric approach assuming the survival data follows a loglogistic distribution model.

For the second project, we will be looking at expanding the scope through the following: 
1. Estimation of the Bayesian parameters with asymmetric loss functions
2. Computational aspects of Bayesian parametric and non-parametric approach
3. Implementation on methods for interval-censored data in R with package Icens and intcox

### Estimation of Bayesian parameters with asymmetric loss functions
